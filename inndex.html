        <p>In my Lakorn House youtube channel, I translate and upload Thai Ost Songs. Since I love to watch Thai Dramas
            and also love to listen Thai Ost songs so much, I started to translate most of the Ost songs from the series
            that I've watched.I also upload about Dramas that I've watched. Now, I'm going to talk about one of the dramas that I've watched.
            It's name is Neung Nai Suang.  Nueng Nai Suang is a Thai television drama series starring Jirayu Tangsrisuk and Urassaya Sperbund. It aired onChannel 3 from May 28 to July 8, 2015.
            Now, I'm going to talk about this drama. Poom, a beautiful girl with no parents, meets Neung at a party. Neung is
            a handsome son of a former renowned diplomat that just came back from studying in France. Every girl wants to get
            to know him. But after the first glance, Neung falls in love with Poom straightaway. He has forgotten that he knew
            her before. On the other hand, Poom deeply remembers that Neung used to bully her when they were young. He always
            bullied her for being chubby and having a feisty attitude toward him. He also looked down on her for not having any
            parents and being someone of lower status. So she really doesn't like him. But when they have to dance together at
            the party, Poom rejects him and runs away. She declares that although he's desired by many women, she will be the
            first one to turn her back and reject him. As someone with status and charisma to get any girl he wanted, this makes
            Neung angry and embarrassed. After figuring out her true identity that she was the same Poom he used to bully, this
            only encourages him to tease her even more because he wants to win against her for rejecting him. He wants to make
            her submit to him and fall for him, all the while unaware that he's already fallen deeply for her.</p>
